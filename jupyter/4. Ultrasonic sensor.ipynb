    "1. Set up the trigger pin as output, and the echo pin as input\n",

    "4. the ultrasonic pulses are bounced back and received by the sensor again, when the echo pin will read LOW again\n",
    "5. the time lapse is measured for the duration in which the echo pin reads HIGH.\n",
    "6. the time lapse is then converted with the sound speed of 343 meters/second into the distance that the ultrasonic waves traveled. Then the result is divided by 2 to get the distance between the sensor and the obstacle. \n",

    "Now you try to run the code. <font color=red>Be sure that when you test the code, the obstacle has a reasonably reflective surface, that is, it should not be fabric or other sound-proofing materials that can absorb ultrasonic waves, such as your pants or a curtain</font>"
